        <strong>Our Mission:</strong> Helping to build, foster, and connect
        communities of Stoics around the world
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="hr"></div>

    <p class="paragraph-center">
      <strong>Vision:</strong> We fulfill our mission by welcoming all aspiring
      and dedicated Stoics, providing tools and resources for local group
      development, maintenance, and growth, supporting participation,
      coordination, and collaboration among the member Stoas, and promoting the
      collective work of The Fellowship in collaboration with related
      individuals, groups, and organizations.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Values:</strong> Living ethics form an integral part of our
      philosophy. Below are the group’s primary principles and values, as we
      seek to embody the lessons of Stoicism in all our activities.
      <br />
    </p>

    <div class="center">
      <h3>Socratic Foundation</h3>
      <strong>"I only know one thing, and that is that I know nothing."</strong>
    </div>

    <p class="paragraph-center">
      The Stoic Fellowship relies on reason, scholarship, and the examples of
      our forebearers for guidance. We make no claims that Stoicism is useful or
      appropriate for everyone and we recognize that happiness is a personal
      journey that must be taken up by the individual.
    </p>

    <div class="center">
      <h3>The Foundation of Philosophy</h3>
      <strong>The Promise of Philosophy is one of belonging</strong>
    </div>

    <p class="paragraph-center">
      The Stoic Fellowship, to quote Seneca, "measure[s] the boundaries of our
      citizenship by the sun" and not "by accident of birth". As such, all
      aspiring Stoics are welcome as we seek to strengthen our natural bonds of
      fellowship.
    </p>

    <div class="center">
      <strong
        >The Purpose of our Philosophy is well-being through understanding and
        virtue</strong
      >
    </div>

    <p class="paragraph-center">
      Through mutual support for individual and group progress towards
      eudaimonia, we openly provide resources and tools that have proven helpful
      in the lives of other Stoics.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph-center"></p>
    <div class="center">
      <h3>The Foundation of Discipline and Virtue</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="paragraph-center">
      The Stoic Fellowship approaches its goals minding the three Stoic
      Disciplines and the Four Cardinal Virtues:
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph-center">
      <strong>Discipline of Reason</strong> – Corresponding to the Virtue of
      Wisdom: objective thinking and seeking of knowledge
      <br />

      <strong>Discipline of Desire</strong> – Corresponding to the Virtues of
      Temperance and Courage: poised and self-disciplined
      <br />

      <strong>Discipline of Action</strong> – Corresponding to the Virtue of
      Justice: fair and beneficent
      <br />
      <br />

        contributes positively to a peaceful, healthy and sustainable world.
