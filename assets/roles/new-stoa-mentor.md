## About This Role

Are you an experienced Stoic community leader who enjoys helping others succeed? The Stoic Fellowship is looking for New Stoa Mentors to support first-time organizers in starting and growing their own local or virtual Stoic groups. As a mentor, you’ll serve as a trusted guide—offering encouragement, practical advice, and lived experience to help new leaders feel confident and supported.

This role is an opportunity to pass on what you’ve learned, strengthen our global network, and ensure that every new Stoa has a solid foundation rooted in Stoic values.

## Responsibilities

- Welcome new Stoa organizers and help orient them to TSF’s mission, tools, and resources
- Offer one-on-one mentorship during the early stages of group formation
- Share your own experiences and lessons learned as a community leader
- Help troubleshoot common challenges related to group dynamics, consistency, outreach, and engagement
- Connect organizers with relevant guides, event ideas, or contacts across the Fellowship network
- Collaborate with other volunteers to identify recurring needs and improve onboarding processes
- Maintain alignment with Stoic virtues—especially wisdom, justice, and kindness—in your mentorship practice

## Ideal Qualities

- Passion for Stoicism and enthusiasm for supporting new leaders
- Prior experience starting or leading a Stoic group (or similar community)
- Empathetic, patient communicator with strong listening skills
- Able to offer practical, thoughtful feedback without judgment
- Comfortable mentoring asynchronously via email, chat, or video calls
- Desire to contribute to a mission-focused and volunteer-driven organization

## Time Commitment

This is a flexible volunteer role. We ask for a commitment of **5-10 hours per month**, with occasional check-ins depending on the number of active mentees. Ideal for leaders looking to give back and support the next generation of organizers.

## Benefits of Volunteering

- Directly support the success and sustainability of new Stoic communities
- Strengthen connections within the global Stoic network
- Share your wisdom and leadership experience in a meaningful way
- Collaborate with aligned volunteers and TSF leaders
