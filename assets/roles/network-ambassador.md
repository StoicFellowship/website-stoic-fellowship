## About This Role

Do you enjoy building relationships and spreading ideas that matter? The Stoic Fellowship is looking for Network Ambassadors to help promote key initiatives, resources, and opportunities across our global network of Stoas and affiliated communities.

As a Network Ambassador, you’ll serve as a connector—sharing updates, gathering feedback, and helping ensure that Stoics everywhere are aware of what's happening across the broader Fellowship. This is a great role for someone who enjoys outreach, communication, and helping others feel included in a shared mission.

- Passion for Stoicism and enthusiasm for connecting with others who share Stoic values
- Strong communication and relationship-building skills
- Comfortable sharing updates in group chats, forums, social media, or local meetups
- Familiarity with The Stoic Fellowship’s mission and structure (or a desire to learn)
- Organized, proactive, and motivated to take initiative in your community

## Time Commitment

This is a flexible volunteer role. We ask for a commitment of **5-10 hours per month**, though this may vary depending on current initiatives and your availability. Ideal for those looking for a lighter but meaningful way to contribute.
