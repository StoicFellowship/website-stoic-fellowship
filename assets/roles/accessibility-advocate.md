## About This Role

Do you believe that Stoic wisdom should be accessible to everyone? The Stoic Fellowship is looking for an Accessibility Advocate to help ensure our digital content and tools meet WCAG 2.1+ standards and reflect a commitment to inclusive, equitable design.

As an Accessibility Advocate, you’ll help identify barriers, improve user experiences, and embed best practices across our digital products and public-facing materials. Your contributions will help us create a welcoming, usable space for all Stoics—online and around the world.

## Responsibilities

- Review web pages, forms, and UI components for compliance with WCAG 2.1+ guidelines
- Collaborate with designers, developers, and content creators to implement accessibility improvements
- Offer guidance on semantic HTML, ARIA roles, color contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and more
- Contribute to the development of internal accessibility checklists and QA workflows
- Stay informed about emerging standards and share knowledge with other TSF volunteers
- Maintain alignment with Stoic virtues—especially justice, wisdom, and courage—in your advocacy work

## Ideal Qualities

- Passion for Stoicism and a commitment to inclusive, community-centered design
- Familiarity with WCAG standards, accessibility testing tools (like WAVE, Axe, or Lighthouse), and assistive technologies
- Ability to communicate accessibility concepts to both technical and non-technical teammates
- Experience with front-end development, UX, or content strategy is a plus—but not required
- Empathy, patience, and a continuous learning mindset

## Time Commitment

This is a flexible volunteer role. We ask for a commitment of **3-5 hours per month**, but you’re welcome to contribute based on your availability and interest level. Both short-term audits and ongoing collaboration are welcome.

## Benefits of Volunteering

- Help shape a more inclusive and accessible Stoic community
- Share your knowledge and expand your experience through mission-driven projects
- Collaborate with a remote, values-aligned team of volunteers
- Create visible, meaningful improvements that impact real users
- Earn public recognition, volunteer badges, and the opportunity to be featured in TSF communications
