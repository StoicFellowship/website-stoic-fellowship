## About This Role

Are you someone who enjoys building meaningful, long-term relationships and expressing gratitude in thoughtful ways? The Stoic Fellowship is looking for a volunteer to help nurture our community of supporters by serving as a bridge between donors and the mission they care about. As a Donor Relations volunteer, you’ll help ensure our contributors feel appreciated, informed, and inspired by the impact of their support.

This role is ideal for someone who believes in personal connection, clear communication, and sustaining generosity over time.

## Responsibilities

- Collect informal feedback from donors to help improve future fundraising efforts
- Maintain alignment with Stoic virtues—especially gratitude, justice, and temperance—in all interactions

## Ideal Qualities

- Passion for Stoicism and an appreciation for the generosity of others
- Warm, clear communication style and an eye for thoughtful details
- Organized and reliable, with the ability to follow through on outreach tasks
- Experience in donor stewardship, relationship-building, or customer service (a plus, but not required)
- Discretion and care when handling personal donor information
- Enjoys helping others feel seen and connected to a greater purpose

## Time Commitment

This is a flexible volunteer role. We ask for a commitment of **5–10 hours per month**, though some periods (e.g. post-campaign follow-up) may be slightly busier. A great role for those who value consistency and connection.
