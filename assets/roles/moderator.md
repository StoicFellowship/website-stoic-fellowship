## About This Role

Are you committed to thoughtful, respectful dialogue and interested in helping uphold the quality of Stoic discourse online? The Stoic Fellowship is seeking volunteer Moderators to help maintain constructive, virtue-aligned conversations across our forums, chat groups, and social platforms.

As a Moderator, you’ll help create and preserve an online environment where Stoics of all backgrounds can engage in meaningful discussion rooted in wisdom, justice, courage, and temperance.

## Responsibilities

- Monitor conversations in TSF-managed spaces (forums, chat groups, comment threads, etc.)
- Ensure that community guidelines are followed and discussions remain respectful and constructive
- Intervene when necessary to de-escalate conflict, remove harmful content, or remind users of our shared values
- Welcome new members and model Stoic behavior through your presence and tone
- Collaborate with other moderators and community managers to improve moderation strategy and tools
- Report issues, patterns, or feedback to the broader volunteer team
- Uphold Stoic virtues—especially justice, moderation, and courage—in your moderation work

## Ideal Qualities

- Passion for Stoicism and a desire to support civil, productive discourse
- Clear, calm, and respectful communication style
- Familiarity with basic moderation tools and workflows (or willingness to learn)
- Ability to remain impartial and respond to tense situations with composure and fairness
- Comfortable making judgment calls while respecting nuance
- Experience in online communities, moderation, or admin roles is a plus—but not required

## Time Commitment

This is a flexible volunteer role. We ask for a commitment of **3-5 hours per week**, depending on the platform and volume of activity. Scheduling is often flexible and can be done in short, regular check-ins.

## Benefits of Volunteering

- Play a vital role in protecting the integrity of Stoic dialogue
- Help foster inclusive, high-quality conversations aligned with ancient wisdom
- Develop moderation, conflict resolution, and digital leadership skills
- Collaborate with a principled and welcoming team of volunteers
