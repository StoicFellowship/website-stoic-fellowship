## About This Role

Are you passionate about technology and interested in applying your skills to support the global Stoic community? The Stoic Fellowship is looking for volunteer software engineers to help us design, build, and maintain tools that empower Stoic groups and individuals around the world. You’ll be part of a mission-driven team working to create open-source web applications, improve existing infrastructure, and support the digital evolution of Stoic communities.

Our tech stack includes: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, MySQL, Supabase, APIs, and Netlify. Familiarity with any of these technologies is helpful—but above all, we're looking for individuals who are curious, collaborative, and committed to Stoic principles.

## Responsibilities

- Collaborate with other TSF volunteers, including designers, product managers, and community leaders, to scope and implement new features
- Build and maintain web applications, APIs, or integrations that power The Stoic Fellowship’s digital tools
- Contribute clean, well-documented, and maintainable code to our open-source repositories
- Participate in code reviews, testing, and deployment processes
- Help troubleshoot and resolve bugs or technical issues as they arise
- Offer technical input on future features and architecture decisions
- Maintain alignment with Stoic virtues—especially wisdom, justice, and courage—through your volunteer service

## Ideal Qualities

- Passion for Stoicism and the desire to support its global community
- Experience with modern web development (React, JavaScript, CSS/HTML); full-stack experience is a plus
- Familiarity with Git, open-source collaboration, and version control workflows
- Strong communication and collaboration skills—especially in remote or async teams
- Interest in building tools that are meaningful, ethical, and community-focused
- Self-motivated and comfortable working in an independent, volunteer-driven environment
- Willingness to learn and contribute to evolving projects—even if you're still early in your coding journey

## Time Commitment

This is a flexible volunteer role. We ask for a commitment of **5-10 hours per month**, but your availability may vary depending on the project or sprint. We welcome both short-term and long-term contributors.

## Benefits of Volunteering
