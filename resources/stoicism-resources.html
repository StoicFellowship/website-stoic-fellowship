    <h4>Why is it called a Stoa?</h4>
    <p style="text-align: left">
      The Stoa Poikile (Ancient Greek: ἡ ποικίλη στοά, hē poikílē stoá) or
      Painted Portico was a Doric stoa (a covered walkway or portico) erected
      around 460 BC on the north side of the Ancient Agora of Athens. It was one
      of the most famous sites in ancient Athens, owing its fame to the
      paintings and war-booty displayed within it and to its association with
      ancient Greek philosophy, especially Stoicism.¹

        two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive,
        and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical.
        Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and
        biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of
        intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior.

        have in common with the wing of a fly? Are breasts, sweat glands, and
        scales connected in some way? To better understand the inner workings of
        our bodies and to trace the origins of many of today's most common
        diseases, we have to turn to unexpected sources: worms, flies, and even
        fish.

        cup of coffee, Seneca’s wisdom provides us with a steady stream of
        time-tested advice about the human condition—which, as it turns out,
        hasn’t changed much over the past two thousand years.

        the psychological insights and the practical techniques of the Stoics,
        Irvine offers a roadmap for anyone seeking to avoid the feelings of
        chronic dissatisfaction that plague so many of us. Irvine looks at
        various Stoic techniques for attaining tranquility and shows how to put

        philosophy that inspired the great emperor Marcus Aurelius, as the best
        way to attain it. Stoicism is a pragmatic philosophy that focuses our
        attention on what is possible and gives us perspective on what is
        unimportant.

        situations that are beyond our control—such as preparing for a meeting,
        waiting for test results, or arguing with a loved one. But we can
        control our response to these everyday tensions—through the wisdom and
        practice of Stoicism. Stoicism is an ancient pragmatic philosophy that
        teaches us to step back, gain perspective, and act with intention.

        >
        by Julia Annas. Ancient ethical theories, based on the notions of virtue
        and happiness, have struck many as an attractive alternative to modern
        theories. But we cannot find out whether this is true until we
        understand ancient ethics--and to do this we need to examine the basic
        structure of ancient ethical theory, not just the details of one or two
        theories.

        >
        by Margaret Graver. On the surface, Stoicism and emotion seem like
        contradictory terms. Yet the Stoic philosophers of ancient Greece and
        Rome were deeply interested in the emotions, which they understood as
        complex judgments about what we regard as valuable in our surroundings.

        by Pierre Hadot. The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius are treasured today
        - as they have been over the centuries - as an inexhaustible source of
        wisdom. And as one of the three most important expressions of Stoicism,
        this is an essential text for everyone interested in ancient religion
        and philosophy. Yet the clarity and ease of the work's style are
        deceptive. Pierre Hadot, eminent historian of ancient thought, uncovers
        new levels of meaning and expands our understanding of its underlying
        philosophy.

        and finally, the ongoing confrontation with Stoicism.

          >The Role Ethics of Epictetus: Stoicism in Ordinary Life</a
        >
        by Brian Johnson. The book offers an original interpretation of
        Epictetus's ethics and how he bases his ethics on an appeal to our roles
        in life. Epictetus believes that every individual is the bearer of many
        roles from sibling to citizen and that individuals are morally good if
        they fulfill the obligations associated with these roles.

          >Epictetus: A Stoic and Socratic Guide to Life</a
        >
        by A.A. Long. The philosophy of Epictetus, a freed slave in the Roman
        Empire, has been profoundly influential on Western thought: it offers
        not only stimulating ideas but practical guidance in living one's life.
        A. A. Long, a leading scholar of later ancient philosophy, gives the
        definitive presentation of the thought of Epictetus for a broad
        readership.

          >The Roman Stoics: Self, Responsibility, and Affection</a
        >
        by Gretchen Reydams-Schils. The book reexamines the philosophical basis
        that instructed social practice in friendship, marriage, parenting, and
        community life. From this analysis, Stoics emerge as neither cold nor
        detached, as the stereotype has it, but all too aware of their human
        weaknesses.

          >The Art of Living: The Stoics on the Nature and Function of
          Philosophy</a
        >
        by John Sellars. The book considers the Socratic background to Stoic
        thinking about philosophy and Skeptical objections raised by Sextus
        Empiricus, and offers readings of late Stoic texts by Epictetus and
        Marcus Aurelius.

          >Stoicism</a
        >
        By John Sellars. This book is a great introduction into many Stoic
        philosophers and their ideas. It is easily accessible for the average
        reader and provides good historical context. It covers the three main
        branches of Stoic theories and explores many other popular Stoic ideas
        such as the Dichotomy of control.
