      <strong>Step Two // Find a Decent Place to Meet:</strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      Generally noisy places don't work for obvious reasons, and restaurants
      aren't great, either, since you'll have to chat between food orders. Some
      places that work for many communities include:
    </p>
    <ul class="paragraph-center-list">
      <li>Outdoors (hiking or sitting, weather permitting)</li>
      <li>Indoor public atria</li>
      <li>Reserving a room in a library, university, community center, etc.</li>
      <li>Quiet coffee shops or bars without table service</li>
      <li>Members' homes</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="paragraph-center">
      <strong>Step Three // What to Do in Your Community:</strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      Our member Stoas do a lot of different things, so there's no one fixed way
      to run a meeting. There are two general points that do apply to many
      groups, though:
    </p>
    <ul class="paragraph-center-list">
      <li>
        Do what your members want! Ask if they prefer readings, practice groups,
        or something else.
      </li>
      <li>
        It helps to have a point of focus at each meeting, whether it be a
        topic, a type of format that you repeat, or a reading. Open formats tend
        to wander and feel unfocused.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="paragraph-center">
      <strong
        >Here are some ideas for topics or formats to get you started for your
        first several months:</strong
      >
    </p>
    <ul class="paragraph-center-list">
      <li>
        <a href="assets/pdfs/Stoicism-101.pdf" target="_blank">Stoicism 101</a>
        - for your first meeting, give a brief talk and discussion on your
        understanding of Stoicism, then open it up for discussion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Read and discuss the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy's
        <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/stoicism/" target="_blank"
          >entry on Stoicism</a
        >, which is a fairly easy read and a good introduction to Stoicism.
      </li>
      <li>
        Focus on readings or videos from our
        <a href="/resources/stoicism-resources.html" target="_blank"
          >resources section</a
        >. Don't bite off more than you and your attendees can chew, though! You
        can digest a book together over several months.
      </li>
      <li>
        Euthydemus - Socrates does a good job in this dialogue explaining why
        Wisdom (close to virtue) is the highest good, which makes for an
        excellent introduction to Stoicism. The NYC Stoics have excerpted the
        relevant portion of the dialogue
        <a
          href=" https://www.meetup.com/New-York-City-Stoics/pages/7255362/Reading%3A_excerpt_from_the_Euthydemus"

      </li>
      <li>
        Have a "topic of the month" for discussion, where you give a brief
        introduction to a common problem many people may have, and talk about it
        from a Stoic perspective. Topics can include anger, anxiety, friendship,
        and more.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Stoic Fellowship activities committee's goal is to provide guidance
        for meeting topics for your community, and has themes they can provide
        you which can guide you in running your community.
